# ProjectLuna

Projectluna is being developed by students at UMSL as part of a group project.

Group members:

  - Vasyl Onufriyev 
  
  Note: 
  Contributions included testing, documentation, team communicator, proper Git standards. 
  
  Coding contributions: UI, Menu, tutorial, puzzles, music. All coding contributions were deleted or not merged. 
  
  Idea contributions: All ideas were dismissed or deleted, such as a female warrior. All strategies to make gameplay interesting
  and give fighting a purpose, other then slashing enemies with a sword, were deleted. Any attempt to plan the project, was not allowed.     Originally, my idea was to give players random strength, health and hitting power in the beginning of the game. There would be trophies   that would increase strength, health or hitting power, protected by enemies. In addition, there would be five badges with different       levels of ememies, you must gather to complete the game. As a compromise, team agreed to have puzzles with objects that needed to be       gathered in a specific time frame and order. When puzzle was completed, a magic creature chased the player to the next quadrant of the     game. This agreed upon gameplay was deleted from the game, with no discussion, even though some work was completed.
